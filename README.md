# Turn the visual of a mockup into a website code

- Make this visual [maquette.jpg]

I do Htlm file + Css file [zozor2.html]+[zozor2.css]

- Make this visual with a window smaller than 1024 [maquette_1024.resp.jpg]
	- the navigation menu will be arranged in height rather than in width, and the links will be written in smaller.
	- the banner with the San Francisco Bridge (the Golden Gate) will be deleted, because it takes up a lot of space and does not provide much information.
	- the <aside> block "About the author" will be placed under the article (and not next to it), and its content will be reorganized (Zozor's photo will be positioned floating).

I do an additionnal Css file [zozor2_1024.css]. Create a secondary css page, allows me to practice working with many css pages
